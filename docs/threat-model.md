# capwall threat model

This document is the source of truth for **what capwall protects against and what it does
not.** Read it before relying on capwall. If you change the engine, keep this document in
sync — overclaiming here is a security bug.

## One-sentence summary

capwall is **pragmatic, runtime, per-package defense-in-depth against opportunistic
supply-chain malware.** It is **not** a formal sandbox and does not withstand a determined
in-process attacker.

## Adversary we are designed to stop

**Opportunistic, worm-style supply-chain malware** delivered through a compromised npm
dependency. Concretely, the class exemplified by:

- **Shai-Hulud** (Nov 2025) — a self-propagating npm worm.
- **Glassworm** (2026) — malware that runs at **both** the lifecycle-script (install) phase
  **and** the application-runtime phase.

The critical observation: these payloads execute at **application runtime**, not only at
install. Install-time defenses — lockfile pinning, `--ignore-scripts`, registry scanners,
socket brokers — never see the runtime phase, where credential theft, wallet drain, and
lateral movement actually happen. capwall lives in the running process and mediates that
phase.

Such malware is typically **opportunistic**: it tries to read `process.env`, open a socket
to an exfiltration host, spawn a shell, or write to a persistence path. It does **not** go
out of its way to break out of a capability shim. That is exactly the behavior capwall's
per-package capability policy catches: a logger that suddenly opens a network socket, or a
string-formatting helper that reads environment secrets, is a policy violation.

## What capwall stops

When a package's declared capabilities are tight, capwall denies (in `enforce` mode) or logs
(in `observe` mode) attempts by that package to:

- Read/write files outside its allowed path globs (`fs`).
- Open network connections to hosts/ports outside its allowlist (`net`, `http(s)`).
- Spawn subprocesses when `child_process` is not permitted (**gating** the spawn).
- Spin up `worker_threads` when not permitted.
- Read `process.env` keys outside its allowlist (e.g. exfiltrating `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  from a package with no reason to see it).
- Use `vm` when not permitted.

The **trace→policy DX** makes those policies practical to author: run once in `observe`,
emit a starter policy scoped to what each package *actually* did, tighten it, enforce.

## What capwall does NOT stop (out of scope for confinement)

capwall does **not** harden JavaScript primordials (that is SES's job — see below). Without
frozen primordials, a **determined in-process attacker** can defeat it via, among others:

- **Prototype pollution** and **shared mutable primordials** — mutating
  `Object.prototype`/`Array.prototype`/etc. to influence code in other packages, or to
  tamper with capwall's own bookkeeping.
- **Un-patching the shims** — reaching for the original, un-wrapped core module reference
  (e.g. via `process.binding`, internal module caches, or re-`require` tricks) and calling
  it directly.
- **fd / symlink escapes** — using an already-open file descriptor, or a symlink, to reach a
  path outside the allowed globs.
- **`vm` / `eval` / `node:sqlite`** and similar reflective or alternate-execution surfaces
  that can sidestep the shimmed API.
- **Native `.node` addons** — arbitrary compiled code; capwall can gate *whether* an addon
  loads but cannot confine what it does once loaded.
- **Subprocess internals** — capwall can gate *whether* a `child_process` spawn happens, but
  once a child process runs it is outside capwall's process and outside its confinement.

**Gating vs confinement.** For native addons and subprocesses, capwall provides **gating**
(a policy decision about whether they are allowed to start) but **not confinement** (control
over what they do after starting). Do not treat a gated-but-allowed addon or subprocess as
confined.

## Comparison to other threat models

### vs SES / hardened primordials (LavaMoat, Endo)

SES freezes the primordials and runs each package in a compartment, so prototype pollution
and primordial-tampering attacks in the list above are largely **in scope** for SES to stop.
capwall accepts those as **out of scope** in exchange for **no SES tax**: no broken packages
from frozen intrinsics, no uneven ESM/native-addon story, near-zero adoption friction.
capwall offers *weaker isolation, dramatically lower friction*. For a hostile,
break-out-motivated adversary, prefer SES; for containing opportunistic supply-chain malware
in an existing Node service with minimal changes, capwall is the pragmatic choice. The two
are composable.

### vs Node's `--permission` model

Node's built-in permission model is **process-global**: one `--allow-fs-read` set applies to
the entire process, so you cannot say "express may read `./views`, but this transitive dep
may read nothing." capwall's contribution is exactly the **per-package** dimension. Node's
model, being enforced deeper (in the runtime, not via JS shims), is harder to un-patch —
another reason capwall is defense-in-depth *alongside* it, not a replacement.

### vs scanners (guarddog, Socket)

Scanners try to **detect** a malicious package before or as it enters your tree. capwall
assumes detection failed and a bad package is present, then **contains what it can do at
runtime.** Complementary layers, not competitors.

## Residual risk statement

Deploying capwall in `enforce` mode meaningfully raises the cost of opportunistic
supply-chain malware and gives you a per-package audit trail. It does **not** provide a
security boundary against a determined, capwall-aware in-process attacker. Treat it as one
layer of defense-in-depth, alongside dependency review, lockfile pinning, least-privilege
process/OS sandboxing (containers, seccomp), and secret hygiene.
